## Building with PlatformIO (Recommended)

[PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) is the recommended build system for firmware development. It provides consistent builds, dependency management, and command-line tooling.

### Installation

```bash
# Using pip
pip install platformio

# Or using Homebrew (macOS)
brew install platformio
```

### Quick Start

```bash
# Build and upload controller firmware
cd firmware/controller
pio run -t upload

# Build and upload joystick firmware
cd firmware/joystick
pio run -t upload
```

**Important:** Before uploading, verify only one Teensy is connected:
```bash
pio device list
```
If multiple devices appear, disconnect the extras before uploading. The upload tool may not warn you and could flash the wrong board.

### Common Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pio run` | Compile firmware |
| `pio run -t upload` | Compile and upload to device |
| `pio run -t clean` | Clean build artifacts |
| `pio device monitor` | Open serial monitor |
| `pio run -t upload && pio device monitor` | Upload and monitor |
| `pio test -e native` | Run unit tests (no hardware required) |

### Running Tests

Unit tests run on your host machine without needing hardware:

```bash
cd firmware/controller
pio test -e native
```

**Example output:**
```
test_crc8:      test_crc8_empty_data           [PASSED]
test_crc8:      test_crc8_single_byte_zero     [PASSED]
test_protocol:  test_command_ids_are_unique    [PASSED]
...
================= 11 test cases: 11 succeeded =================
```

Tests are located in `controller/test/` and use the [Unity](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity) test framework.

### Build Output

After successful compilation, the firmware binary is located at:
- `.pio/build/teensy41/firmware.hex` (controller)
- `.pio/build/teensyLC/firmware.hex` (joystick)

### Troubleshooting

**Device not found during upload:**
- Ensure Teensy is connected via USB
- Check that no other application is using the serial port
- If firmware is unresponsive, press the button on Teensy to enter bootloader mode

**Permission denied (Linux):**
```bash
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
# Log out and back in
```

**First build is slow:**
- PlatformIO downloads toolchains and libraries on first run
- Subsequent builds are much faster (incremental compilation)

## Building with Arduino IDE (Alternative)

If you prefer Arduino IDE:

### Controller (Teensy 4.1)

1. Install [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html)
2. Open `controller/main_controller_teensy41.ino` in Arduino IDE
3. Select Board: "Teensy 4.1"
4. Click Upload

### Joystick (Teensy LC)

1. Install [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html)
2. Open `joystick/control_panel_teensyLC.ino` in Arduino IDE
3. Select Board: "Teensy LC"
4. Click Upload

## Controller

The main motion controller firmware for Teensy 4.1. Handles:
- XYZ stage motion control (TMC4361A + TMC2660 drivers)
- Illumination control (lasers and LED matrix)
- Camera triggering
- Serial communication with host software

### Configuration

Hardware-specific settings are in `src/def/def_v1.h`. This includes:
- Motor parameters (steps per rev, microstepping, current)
- Stage limits and velocities
- Joystick sensitivity
- Limit switch polarity

### Build Options

**Disable Laser Safety Interlock:**

By default, the firmware includes laser safety interlock detection. To disable it:

```bash
PLATFORMIO_BUILD_FLAGS="-DDISABLE_LASER_INTERLOCK" pio run -e teensy41 -t upload
```

> **WARNING:** Only use this flag for systems without lasers installed. Disabling the interlock removes laser safety protection.
